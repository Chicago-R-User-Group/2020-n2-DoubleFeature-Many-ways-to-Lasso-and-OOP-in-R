We have another exciting meetup, featuring Jared Lander, author of author of "R for Everyone" as well as Anthony Shook, Lead Data Scientist at Jellyvision Labs, inc.

Doors open at 5:30 talks begin at 6 pm. Vittles will be served, sponsored by IBM!

**Jared Lander: Many ways to Lasso**

**Anthony Shook, Ph.D: Object-Oriented Programming in R**

Anthony started using R more than 10 years ago because he hated Excel, and has never looked back! A former Northwestern Professor, Anthony will teach us about S3, S4, and R6 object oriented systems in R. https://www.jellyvision.com/ https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajshook/

Jared P. Lander is Chief Data Scientist of Lander Analytics, the Organizer of the New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup and the New York, Washington DC and Dublin R Conferences and an Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School. He is the author of R for Everyone, a book about R Programming geared toward Data Scientists and Non-Statisticians alike. His writings on statistics can be found at jaredlander.com.
The Lasso remains an excellent statistical learning technique for modeling data sets containing many variables/features. While glmnet remains the classic package for applying the approach using R, Jared will show us how one can Lasso with additional R packages interfacing Keras, lars, Stan, xgboost, spark, and quadratic programming.
